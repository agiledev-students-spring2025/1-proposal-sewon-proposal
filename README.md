# Project Proposal

## Project Title
MealGuide

## What is this project?
MealGuide is a mobile web application that allows users to track their recipes and schedule/plan their meals for future dates as recipes.

## Why do we need this?
MealGuide is important for people who wish to catalog their personal recipes and dishes for future use. Additionally, the ability to schedule meals for the future are important for planning ahead.

## Who are the end users?
Some end users of this product would be me, my mom/dad, and my apartment roommate.

For instance, my parents would greatly benefit from the functionality of planning meals in future dates. Given their busy schedules, it is necessary to organize and assign which recipes/meals should be cooked and eaten on which days.

Me and my roommate would benefit from the functionality of tracking recipes within the app. As we are actively cooking and learning new recipes, it is necessary that we record our ingredients, measurements, cook times, etc. within a reliable storage medium. MealGuide provides a convenient user interface for us to do this.

## How will this system function for the end user?
This mobile web application will consist of 3 primary pages in order to support the functionalities mentioned above.

### Recipe List Page
On this page, the user will see a list of recipes laid out in a vertical list format. Each recipe cell will contain the recipe name, ingredients & measurements, total cook time, list of steps, and a recipe image as its attributes.

Each recipe is public or private. A public recipe will be viewable by other users that navigate to the end user's profile page. Additionally, public recipes have a rating system, in which people can leave a rating on a numerical scale (1-5).

### Meal Planner Page
This page will provide the end user with an interface to schedule their recipes for future dates. The user interface consists of an upper half and a lower half.

On the upper half lies a calendar UI, marking the date/times in which recipes are scheduled. On the lower half lies a form. The user can interact with this form to create a new recipe schedule by entering the recipe and date/time.

### User Profile Page
This page will display the user's profile information (name, profile picture, social links) as well as a list of their public recipes.

## Scope
Given the specifications of this project, MealGuide is not an overly ambitious idea for a group of programmers. It supports two primary functionalities that are feasible to implement and are not overly complicated.

On the other hand, MealGuide is not an overly easy/simple project either. Given the existence of user profiles and storage of recipe data, this application will need to provide a method of database storage for incoming recipes and any data on user accounts. User authentication and login/registration pages must also be implemented to support user account creation.

In addition, the user interface for creating a calendar visualization (Meal Planner Page) and the recipe list cells are not simple to implement. Extensive design and programming will be required to setup these visualizations in a seamless manner for the end user.
